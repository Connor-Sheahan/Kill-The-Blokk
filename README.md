# Kill-The-Blokk 
This is a small game I made in grade 10 (2019) for my high school computer science class; the game was coded in python using the pygame library. Despite not updating the graphic, I changed the name from "Shoot or Die" to "Kill The Blokk" because let's be real, it's 10 times cooler!

This was my first big fully original game, and I'm very pleased with how it turned out. The goal of the game is to kill the big bad red blokk (ooo scary) by shooting it, all the while dodging the blue lasers that the blokk will be shooting at you.

My favourite feature of this game is the way you can move off one side of the screen and appear at the other side. I coded this all originally with no online references, so it was a challenge figuring out how to implement this feature, but it was totally worth the pride I felt when I eventually figured it out and got the mechanism to work.

Controls: Spacebar to shoot, left and right arrows keys to move, up arrow key to jump, and down arrow key to fall through platforms.

Although this game was coded using an old version of python and pygame, it seems to work on newer versions too (I ran it on python 3.8.5 and pygame 2.1.0 with no issues).
